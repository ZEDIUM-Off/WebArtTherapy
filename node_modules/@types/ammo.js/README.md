# Ammo.js Typings

TypeScript type definitions auto-generated by parsing official WebIDL bindings for [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js).

## What is Ammo.js?

[Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js) is direct port of the [Bullet physics engine](http://bulletphysics.org) to JavaScript using [Emscripten](http://emscripten.org).

## Why should I use this package while there are other packages?

There wasn't a complete type definitions package for [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js) before this project has started. This package is developed by parsing official [WebIDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_IDL) bindings of [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js) with a Node.js script automatically. The latest WebIDL bindings of Ammo.js can be found at [https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/blob/master/ammo.idl](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/blob/master/ammo.idl). A copy of "ammo.idl" file is kept in this repository and updated at each release.

## Why is "ammo.idl" file different from Ammo.js repository?

While Emscripten uses a non-conforming WebIDL parser, this package uses [W3C's WebIDL parser](https://github.com/w3c/webidl2.js). So I had to modify "ammo.idl" to pass WebIDL validation. Note that modified "ammo.idl" is not completely correct from the WebIDL specification perspective (e.g. `FrozenArray<T>` is used as a mutable array for an attribute). Since the build script is only specialized for this package, it doesn't matter for our goal. But, corrections and workarounds are always welcome.

## Usage

Currently, there is no NPM package yet. But, you can use it anyway by using the following command:

```shell
$ npm install github:osman-turan/ammo.js-typings
```

## Building

If you want to modify WebIDL bindings and generate corresponding type definitions, clone this repository and run the following command to install required NPM packages:

```shell
$ npm install
```

Then, apply your changes to "ammo.idl" file and run the following command to generate updated type definitions:

```shell
$ npm run build
```
